# Videogames sales data analysis

This dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) contains
a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies, generated by a 
webscrape of [VGChartz](http://www.vgchartz.com/) using a script based on the 
Beautiful Soup library in Python, developed by the same user who shared the data.

It is a topic worth studying to understand which videogame genres are the most 
popular (and how this changed with time), the difference in the number of sales 
and consumer taste in four regions (Europe, North America, Japan and ROW), and what
are the titles with the highest number of copies sold. 

The analysis was carried out using the R programming language and tidyverse packages.
